TODOS:

1. User Profile section - User should be able to set his DP, email, first name, last name, username and add mobile number.

2. In Timer section - As we start timer it should also update start time, and on timer end it should update end time, and allow us to add category, description things directly there itself additionally.

3. In time entry, we should allow user to write description with TEXT MARKUP so he can write descriptive elaboration of what he has done in those times.

4. We should allow user to maintain there TODO list/NOTES and share with their friends. Goals can be set for daily, what things need to be done, note sharing web app

5. Proper header section, where Dark mode, user profile, And time-tracker name and logo would come

6. get-server-session should be cached

7. Optimizations, Improve SEO, fine tuning

8. Respective Color HexCode option, or add manually in categories section

9. AUTH updates, google and other options

10. Push notification service, for reminders, user should be able to set reminders ( Notify me - implement this tab, where user can fill his schedule how he wants it to be, and we will keep sending reminder 10 minutes before each plan/event he has schedules thru PWA/service workers)

11. store the api data in zustand state, and use it from zustand state unless we don't have data in zustand state, whenever post, patch, delete api call happens at that time u can update the zustand state
